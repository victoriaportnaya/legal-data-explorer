Each of these fundamental international agreements is inspired by respect for hu-man personality and dignity; together, they establish the principle of disin-terested aid to all victims of war without discrimination – to all those who, whether through wounds, capture or shipwreck, are no longer enemies but merely suffering and defenceless human beings. \nThroughout the years, the International Committee has laboured unremit-\ntingly for the greater protection in International Law of the individual against the hardships of war; it successively elaborated the humanitarian Conventions and adapted them to current needs, or instituted new ones. In the period between the two World Wars, the Committee’s main achievement lay in the establishment of a number of draft Conventions, chief among which was the Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War; this was signed in the summer of 1929 and, during the last conflict, protected millions of captives. Other new or revised draft Conventions were to have been submitted to a Diplomatic Conference which the Swiss Federal Council planned to convene early in1940; hostilities, unfortunately, intervened.\nThe year 1945 marked the close of a war waged on an unprecedented scale; the \ntask had to be faced of developing and adapting the humanitarian elements of International Law in the light of the experience gained. The International Committee’s proposals met with the early approval of Governments and National Red Cross Societies, and it immediately set to work.\nThree former Conventions had to be revised: the Geneva Convention of 1929 \nfor the Relief of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field, the Xth Hague Convention of 1907 for the adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention, and the 1929 Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Furthermore, there was urgent need for a Convention for the protection of civilians, the absence of which had, during the world con-flict, led to such grievous consequences. THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS  \nof 12 August 1949\n20 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nThe International Committee worked on the lines it had followed after the \n1914-1918 War. First, it collected the fullest possible preliminary information on those aspects of International Law that required confirmation, enlarge-ment, or amendment; then, with the help of experts from various countries, it prepared the revised and new drafts which were submitted, first, to an International Red Cross Conference, and then to a Diplomatic Conference empowered to give these treaties final validity.\nThe first meeting of experts was held in October 1945 and comprised the neu-tral members of the Mixed Medical Commissions which, during the conflict, had visited wounded or sick prisoners of war, to decide about their repatriation.\nThe second meeting was the “Preliminary Conference of National Red Cross Societies for the study of the Conventions and of various problems relative to the Red Cross” , which the International Committee convened at Geneva, in July and August 1946, and before which the first drafts were laid. \nHaving gathered the suggestions of Red Cross agencies on points which were within their particular fields, the Committee made a close study during the months that followed, and collected very full data on all matters dealt with in the proposed Conventions. Consultations included one, in March 1947, with representatives of the religious and secular bodies which had collaborated with the Committee in giving spiritual and intellectual aid to victims of the War.\nFrom April 14 to 26, 1947, the “Conference of Government Experts for the study of Conventions for the Protection of War Victims” was held in Geneva. This was attended by seventy representatives of fifteen Governments which had held large numbers of prisoners and civilian internees during the War, and were therefore particularly experienced in the matters under discussion. Combining the Committee’s proposals, the suggestions made by the Red Cross Societies, and drafts prepared by several Governments, the Conference agreed to the new texts proposed and to the first draft of a Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. \nThe International Committee also sought the advice of several Governments \nwhich were not represented at the April Conference; some sent experts to Geneva in June 1947. The drafts in preparation were also submitted by the Committee to a Special Commission of National Red Cross Societies, which met at Geneva in September of the same year. \nAfter careful editing early in the year, the Draft Conventions were sent by \nthe Committee, in May 1938, to all Governments and National Red Cross Societies, in preparation for the XVIIth International Red Cross Conference.\nThis Conference sat in Stockholm from August 20 to 31, 1948; the represen-\ntatives of fifty Governments and fifty-two National Red Cross Societies were present. With some amendments, the drafts were adopted. \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  21\nAfter passing through the many preparatory stages briefly described, these \ntexts were eventually taken as the sole Working Documents of the Diplomatic Conference of Geneva; out of these grew the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\nThe Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment of International Conven-\ntions for the Protection of Victims of War, convened by the Swiss Federal Council, as trustee of the Geneva Conventions, was held in Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949\nOf the sixty-three Governments represented at the Conference, fifty-nine \nhad sent plenipotentiaries; four sent observers only. Representatives of the International Committee were invited to participate in the capacity of experts.\nAfter four months of continuous debate, the Conference established the fol-\nlowing four Conventions, which are given below: \nI. \n Gen\neva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the \nWounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, of August 12, 1949. \nII.  Gen\neva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, \nSick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, of August 12, \n1949.\nIII.  Gen\neva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, of  \nAugust 12, 1949.\nIV . Gen\neva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in \nTime of War, of August 12, 1949.\nThe Conference at once divided into four Committees; the First, for the revi-sion of Conventions I and II; the Second, for the revision of Convention III (Prisoners of War); the Third, to establish the new Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons; and lastly, the Joint Committee, to deal with provisions common to the four Conventions. Co-ordination and Drafting Committees met towards the end of the Conference, to harmonize the four texts. When necessary, the Committees formed Working Parties.\nAt the closing meeting, Delegations of the following States signed the Final Act: \nAfghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Greece, Guatemala, the Holy See, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jugoslavia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, Soviet Socialist Republic of Bielorussia, Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay, Switzerland. \n22 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nSeventeen Delegations also signed the four Conventions; forty-four other \nStates had signed when the agreed six-months period expired on February 12, 1950. According to their provisions, the new Geneva Conventions come into force six months after the deposit of at least two instruments of ratifica-tion. Thereafter, they come into force for each Contracting Party six months after it ratifies.\nPROVISIONS COMMON TO THE FOUR CONVENTIONS\nThe Geneva Diplomatic Conference made an innovation in grouping to-gether and amplifying the common provisions, up to then dispersed and ru-dimentary. Now practically identical in the four Conventions, they may be considered under three headings: \nGeneral Provisions\nThe General Provisions are given in a dozen Articles of great importance at the beginning of each Convention, laying down the mode of application. They deal with respect for the Conventions and their application in interna-tional conflict, enemy occupation or civil war. They are followed by provisions about the duration of application, special agreements which Contracting Par-ties may conclude, the inalienability of the right of protected persons, the duties of Protecting Powers or their substitutes, the activities of the Interna-tional Committee of The Red Cross, and conciliation procedure between the Contracting Parties. \nRepression of Breaches of the Conventions\n(Articles 49 to 52 of the First Convention, 50 to 53 of the Second, 129 to 131 of the Third, and 146 to 149 of the Fourth). \nThe Stockholm Conference had expressed the view that the provisions it \nhad approved were still inadequate, and had requested the International Committee to continue its study of this important question. After consulting lawyers of international repute, the Committee prepared suggestions which appeared in the volume “Remarks and Proposals” , submitted for consider-ation. The Conference used these suggestions as a basis for its deliberations. \nThe first of the Articles imposes penal sanctions for breaches of the \nConvention, in particular for “grave breaches” , as defined in the succeeding Article. \nThese texts will doubtless be an important contribution towards defining \n“war crimes” in International Law. The term is frequently used and seen in print, but still awaits an acceptable legal definition.\nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  23\nFinal Provisions \nThe Final Provisions appear at the end of each Convention and define the pro-\ncedure for the signature, ratification and entry into force of the Conventions, and for accession to them.\nFIRST GENEVA CONVENTION \n(Wound\ned and  s\nick) \nThe traditional “Geneva Convention” , brought into being by the newly created \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross in 1864, is the source of the “Geneva Conventions” which are now universally accepted. The original Convention gave the impetus to the Red Cross movement throughout the world; it likewise inspired the impulsion in International Law towards an increasing regulation-and, eventually, the restriction and final prohibition – of war itself. This first international treaty, the fundamental principles of which have remained un-shaken, was nevertheless marked by omissions and imperfections, and as early as four years after signature, a Conference was convened to discuss its revision. On October 20, 1868, the Conference proposed a number of additional Arti-cles, providing in particular for the extension of the Convention to maritime warfare, but they were never ratified. A recommendation by the First Hague Conference in 1899 raised the question of revision again. The 1906 Diplomatic Conference established a revised text which recast and considerably developed the 1864 text. \nAfter the First World War, it was clear that the Geneva Conventions needed \nadapting to the conditions of modern warfare. During the 1929 Diplomatic Conference at Geneva, the text was once more revised, although to a lesser extent than on the first occasion. \nIn 1937, after renewed discussion by a Commission of international Experts \ncalled by the International Committee, another revised text was established. The draft, after submission to the XVIth International Red Cross Conference (London, I938), was placed on the agenda of the Diplomatic Conference planned for 1940 but postponed by the Second World War.\nWe have shown how the 1937 draft was shaped by the experience of the six \nmomentous war years. The help of the National Red Cross Societies, closely involved historically in the application and development of the Convention, was particularly valuable. \nThe text of the First Convention, as revised by the 1949 Conference, follows \ntraditional lines and the fundamental principles that governed former versions: wounded or sick – and therefore defenceless – combatants shall be respected \n24 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nand cared for, whatever their nationality; personnel attending them, the buil-\ndings in which they shelter and the equipment used for their benefit, shall be protected; a red cross on a white ground shall be the emblem of this immu-nity. As will be seen later, the greatest divergence arises from the very condi-tions of modern warfare, which made it necessary to restrict the privileges of medical personnel and equipment in enemy hands. On the other hand, almost all Articles have been made more precise. \nThe General Provisions are followed by Chapter II, dealing with the wounded \nand sick. Article 13, drawn from the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention, enu-merates the categories of persons put on the same footing as members of the armed forces, and hence entitled to protection under the Convention. Whereas the 1949 text demanded respect and protection only for the wound-ed, Article 12, which is new, gives a list of prohibited acts: attempts upon life, torture, wilful abandonment and so on. The information to be given about wounded captives, and the duties to the dead have been defined (Art. 16 and 17). A new provision (Art. 18) guarantees to the inhabitants and to Relief Societies the right of assisting the wounded and sick. \nChapter III (Medical Units and Establishments) has not undergone altera-\ntion, except for the introduction of Article 23 (Creation of Safety Zones and Localities).\nChapter IV (Medical Personnel and Chaplains) has been greatly modified. \nHitherto, such personnel falling into enemy hands had to be immediately repatriated.\nThe 1949 Convention provides that they may, in certain circumstances, be \nretained to care for prisoners of war. Their special status and the conditions for the repatriation of those not required (Art. 30 to 32) have been carefully defined (Art. 28), thus filling a serious gap.\nChapter V (Medical Equipment) has been substantially altered, to take \nchanges regarding personnel into account. \nEquipment need no longer be handed back to the belligerent to whom it \nbelongs. \nIn Chapter VI similar provision is made for transport vehicles (Art. 35). It \nshould be noted that medical aircraft are now authorized, in certain circum-stances, to fly over neutral countries (Art. 37). \nChapter VII (Distinctive Emblem) marks no change in principle.

Article 53, which is peculiar to the First Convention, is intended to prevent abuse of the distinctive emblem.\nSECOND GENEVA CONVENTION \n(Mariti Me)\nThe 1868 Diplomatic Conference, at Geneva, formulated the first provisions \nfor the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Con-vention. This draft was not ratified, but later became The Hague Convention of 1899, and afterwards the Xth Hague Convention of 1907, which was rati-fied by forty-seven States and still remains in force. \nNevertheless, evolution in the methods of warfare and the fact that the First \nGeneva Convention was revised in 1929, made a recasting of the Xth Hague Convention essential. After preliminary study, the International Committee, with the help of a Conference of Naval Experts, drafted in 1937 a Revised Convention, which was placed on the agenda of the Diplomatic Conference scheduled for 1940. \nThis draft, extended after 1945 in the light of war experience, was used as a \nbasis by the Diplomatic Conference in 1949. \nThe Maritime Convention, as it is called, is an extension of the First Conven-tion (Wounded and Sick), the terms of which it applies to maritime warfare; it is therefore natural that it should be included among the Geneva Conventions, out of which it originally developed. \nAs the general plan of this Second Geneva Convention covers the same field and protects the same categories of persons as the First, no comment is nec-essary on its basic principles. It contains, however, no less than sixty-three Articles, whereas the 1907 version had only twenty-eight. This is because the 1949 text (similar to the 1937 draft) adapts the provision of the Land Convention and closely follows them. It has thus become a complete and in-dependent Convention, whereas the 1907 Hague text was chiefly concerned to adapt humanitarian provisions to naval warfare. \nFollowing the General Provisions common to the four Conventions, \nChapter II protects the shipwrecked in addition to the wounded and sick. \nMembers of the Merchant Navy are protected under the terms of Article 13, \ninsofar as they are not entitled to more favourable treatment under other pro-visions in International Law. The qualification, new in treaty law, is in confor-mity with ordinary practice.\n26 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nChapter III, obviously applicable only to maritime warfare deals with Hospital \nShips and other relief craft. \nChapter IV . At sea, medical personnel, on account of prevailing conditions, \nare given wider protection than on land. In particular, the medical personnel and crew, vital to the hospital ships as such, may not be captured or retained. The personnel of other ships, while they may in some cases be retained, must be put ashore as soon as possible and will then come under the First Convention. \nChapter V (Medical Transports) has its parallel in the First Convention, but \nthe Maritime Convention makes no special provision for the equipment, which is, in a sense, part and parcel of the vessel itself. \nThere were no fighting aircraft in 1907. Hence the addition, in Chapter VI \n(Distinctive Emblem), of provisions for the more efficient marking of hospital ships, as a safeguard against air attack. \nChapters VII (Execution of the Convention) and VIII (Repression of Abuses \nand Infractions), as well as the Final Provisions, call for no special comment.\nTHIRD GENEVA CONVENTION \n(Prisoners  o\nf War)\nThe Third Convention contains one hundred and forty-three Articles, be-\nsides the Annexes. The corresponding 1929 Convention had ninety-seven Articles, and the Chapter on prisoners of war in the Hague Convention, only seventeen. This extension is no doubt due, in part, to the fact that, in modern warfare, prisoners are held in very large numbers, but it also interprets the desire of the 1949 Conference, representing all nations, to submit all aspects of captivity to humane regulation by International Law. \nThe aspiration is not new. The nineteenth century saw new concepts of \nnatural law and a new humanitarian movement – in particular the ideas of Henry Dunant, who applied himself to the prisoner of war problem after the wounded and sick had been provided for. The civilized world finally accepted the principle that the prisoner of war is not a criminal, but merely an enemy no longer able to bear arms, who should be liberated at the close of hostili-ties, and be respected and humanely treated while in captivity. Far-seeing and broad-minded legal and diplomatic action has since translated concept into practice, through a series of codifications accepted as binding by States, and successively extended or amplified when experience showed them to be inad-equate. The Brussels Draft of 1874, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the special agreements made between belligerents in Berne in 1917 and 1918, and the Geneva Conventions of 1929, which devote all or part of their clauses to prisoners of war, represent the principal stages of this evolution. \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  27\nWherever it was applied, the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention effectively \nhelped to protect the millions of men who relied upon it during the last con-flict. Nevertheless, it was quite evident, both to those who benefited and to those by whom it was applied, that the Convention required revision on many points; there have been changes in the methods and the consequences of war, and even in the living conditions of peoples. It was necessary to broaden the categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war status, so that such status is in fact granted to members of forces which capitulate, and that prison-ers may not be arbitrarily deprived of it, at any time. A more precise defini-tion of the conditions of captivity was also required which would take into account the importance assumed by prisoner of war labour, the relief they receive, and the judicial proceedings instituted against them. The principle of the immediate liberation of prisoners on the close of hostilities had to be reaffirmed. Finally, it was essential that the agencies appointed to look after prisoners’ interests and ensure that regulations concerning them are applied in full, should be as independent as possible of the political relations existing between the belligerents. These were the most urgent only of the problems that the War revealed. \nThus, before hostilities had ceased, and concurrently with the even more ur-\ngent task of preparing a Civilian Convention, the International Committee began to work upon the revision of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention. \nAs already pointed out, the 1939 Convention is far longer than the agreement \nit replaces. But, whilst many of its provisions represent a logical development of the 1929 Convention, experience has shown that the daily lives of prisoners may depend on the interpretation given to a general rule. An attempt has therefore been made to give certain regulations an explicit form, precluding the misinterpretation to which they were formerly open. Moreover, prin-ciples which it was felt would have greater force for being tersely worded-e.g.  Article 2 of the 1929 text had been so seriously violated that the Conference has recast them in terms comprehensive and clear enough to make any future infringement immediately apparent. \nAnother group of provisions is designed to provide a satisfactory solution for \nthe numerous problems outlined above. This task was more difficult. In many instances, the Conference had to devise entirely new regulations as in the Section dealing with the financial resources of prisoners of war-or deliber-ately to break with certain rules which, in 1929, had been transferred more or less bodily from the Hague Regulations. One instance is the rule concerning the liberation of prisoners at the close of hostilities. \nSome of the details may seem superfluous; repetition and lack of harmony \nbetween certain provisions may also cause surprise. It should, however, be \n28 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nremembered that, whilst throughout concerned with the Convention as an \ninstrument in International Law, the Conference had constantly in mind a special use to which it was to be put-regulations to be posted in prisoner of war camps and comprehensible not only to the authorities, but to the ordinary reader. Furthermore, the Conference did not hesitate to sacrifice neatness in the interests of unanimous agreement. These are reasons, which with the dif-ficulty of establishing official legal texts simultaneously in two languages, may account for, and even justify, most of the textual imperfections to be found in the Prisoners of War Convention. \nThe Table which appears at the end of the volume and the marginal notes to \neach Article make it easy to grasp the general plan, which is, as far as pos-sible, similar to that of the 1929 Convention. The general outline is as follows: amongst the general Provisions (Art. I to II), which have already been dealt with, Article 4, defining the categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war treatment, is a vital element of the Convention. \nPart II (General Protection of Prisoners of War, Art. 12 to 16) contains the \nessential principles which shall, at all times and in all places, govern the treat-ment of prisoners. \nPart. III (Art. 17 to 108) deals with the conditions of captivity and is divided into six Sections. The first, (Art.17 to 20) covers events immediately after cap-ture and deals with such matters as interrogation of prisoners, disposal of their personal effects, and their evacuation. The second, comprising eight Chapters (Art. 21 to 48), regulates living conditions for prisoners in camp or during transfer, and deals with the places and methods of internment, accommoda-tion, food and clothing, hygiene and medical attention, medical and religious personnel retained for the care of prisoners (a new Chapter, which partly repro-duces the provisions of the First Convention), religious needs, intellectual and physical activities, discipline, prisoner of war ranks, and transfer after arrival in a camp. Prisoners’ labour is dealt with in the third Section (Art. 49 to 57); the fourth Section (Art. 58 to 68) is new and concerns the financial resources of prisoners. The fifth Section (Art. 69 to 77) covers everything concerned with correspondence and relief shipments. The sixth and last Section (Art. 78 to 108) which is in three Chapters, covers the relations between prisoners of war and the detaining authorities, complaints regarding captivity, prisoners’ repre-sentatives, and penal and disciplinary sanctions. This last Chapter (Art. 82 to 108) constitutes in itself a brief code of penal and disciplinary procedure. \nThe various measures for the termination of captivity are contained in Part IV (Art. 109 to 121), which is divided into three Sections. The first (Art. 109 to 117) refers to repatriation and accommodation of prisoners in neutral coun-tries during hostilities, the second (Art. 118 and 119) to repatriation at the close of hostilities, and the third (Art. 120 and 121) to the death of prisoners of war. \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  29\nPart. V (Art. 122 to 125) contains provisions about Prisoners of War \nInformation Bureaux and all organizations formed to assist prisoners. \nPart. VI (Execution of the Convention, Art. 126 to 143) contains, in the first \nSection (Art. 126 to 132), a variety of most important stipulations requir-ing belligerents, inter alia, to give neutral organizations free access to pris-\noner of war camps for inspection purposes, and to disseminate the text of the Convention as widely as possible. Articles 129 to 131 further contain the provisions common to the four Conventions for the repression of breaches. \nFive Annexes are closely connected with the Convention.  Annex I (Model \nAgreement concerning Direct Repatriation and Accommodation in Neutral Countries of Wounded and Sick Prisoners of War), Annex III (Regulations concerning Collective Relief), and Annex V (Model Regulations concerning Payments sent by Prisoners to their own country) are intended to substitute in the absence of specific agreement on these questions between the belligerents concerned. Annex II (Regulations concerning Mixed Medical Commissions) is prescriptive. Annex IV proposes standard model documents, such as iden-tity or capture cards, correspondence cards, death notifications etc.\nFOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION\n(civili\nans)\nThe Fourth Convention forms an important contribution to written Interna-\ntional Law in the humanitarian domain. \nStrictly speaking, this Convention introduces nothing new in a field where \nthe doctrine is sufficiently well established. It adds no specifically new ideas to International Law on the subject, but aims at ensuring that, even in the midst of hostilities, the dignity of the human person, universally acknowledged in principle, shall be respected. \nThe original humanitarian legislation represented by the First Geneva \nConvention of 1864 provided only for combatants, as at that time it was con-sidered evident that civilians would remain outside hostilities. \nThe Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed \nto the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, made no provision for civilians (apart from spies), except where there was occupation of territory by enemy armed forces. They merely set forth a small number of elementary rules, in pursuance of the principle that the occupant shall “take all the measures in his power to restore, and as far as possible ensure public order and safety while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country” (Art. 43). Thus: “Family honour and rights, the lives of persons and private property, as well as religious convictions and practice, must be respected” (Art. 46); “Pillage is formally forbidden” (Art. 47); “No general penalty,  \n30 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\npecuniary or otherwise, shall be inflicted upon the population on account \nof the acts of individuals for which they cannot be regarded as jointly and severally responsible” (Art. 50). Such were the main and essential provisions, tersely expressed, governing the occupation of territory. \nThe development of arms and the increased radius of action given to armed \nforces by modern inventions have made it apparent that, notwithstanding the ruling theory, civilians were certainly “in the war” , and exposed to the same dangers as the combatants – and sometimes worse. \nThe Xth International Red Cross Conference (1921) – the first after the World \nWar – set forth certain general principles, on the proposal of the International Committee, in regard to deported, evacuated or refugee civilians, these pro-hibited deportation en masse, or without preliminary trial, and the taking \nof hostages; they enjoined liberty of movement, and the right to correspond and to receive relief. In 1923, the XIth International Conference called for a Convention to supplement the Hague Regulations. The XIIth Conference devised regulations for the protection of civilians on the territory of an en-emy State; these recognised the right to leave the territory, unless the safety of the State was involved, and provided for speedier enquiries, Mixed Medical Commissions for the examination of men unfit for service, transmission to the International Committee of lists of retained civilians, the grant to civilians of the same privileges as to prisoners of war, inspection of places of intern-ment, and agreements between belligerents for the benefit of civilians. \nThe 1929 Diplomatic Conference, which revised the First Convention and \ndrew up the Convention for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, unanimously recommended that “careful study should be made with a view to the con-clusion of an international Convention on the conditions and protection of civilians of enemy nationality in the territory of a belligerent, or in bellige-rent-occupied territory” . \nThe International Committee wholeheartedly entered into the task thus de-\nfined, setting up a Legal Commission which prepared a draft Convention in forty Articles. This draft, generally known as the “Tokyo Draft” , was approved by the XVth International Red Cross Conference (Tokyo, 1934). It was in-tended for submission to the Diplomatic Conference planned for 1940, but postponed on account of the War. The International Committee was, at best, able to obtain an undertaking from the belligerent States that the essential provisions of the Prisoners of War Convention would be extended to interned civilians who were in enemy territory at the outbreak of hostilities-as was in fact prescribed in the Tokyo Draft. \nThe events which followed were to show the disastrous consequences of the failure to provide – in addition to the few principles embodied in the Hague Regulations – an international Convention for the protection of civilians in \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  31\nwartime, particularly of those in occupied territories; this tragic period was one \nof deportations, mass extermination, taking and killing of hostages, and pillage. \nImmediately hostilities ceased, therefore, the International Committee, in keeping with its humanitarian duty, informed all Governments and Red Cross Societies of its intention to resume its efforts to set up an international Convention for the protection of civilians. This statement met with universal approval.\nThe Geneva Diplomatic Conference was not called to revise the Fourth Ha-\ngue Convention. The Civilian Convention of August 12, 1949, therefore in no way invalidates the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land; it is not a substitute for that agreement, which remains in force. As happily expressed by the Conference, the Convention “shall be supplemen-tary to Sections II and III” of the said Regulations. (See Fourth Convention, Art. 154.) \nThe new Convention contains one hundred and fifty-nine Articles and two \nAnnexes. According to the text of a draft Preamble submitted by the French and Finnish Delegations – but not adopted, as the Conference decided to follow the precedent of the other Geneva Conventions, which contain no Preamble – it is inspired by “the eternal principles of that Law which is the foundation and the safeguard of civilization “, and is designed to “ ensure the respect of human personality and dignity by putting beyond reach of attack those rights and liberties which are the essence of its existence” . \nIt prohibits in particular: \na)\n Vio\nlence to life and person, in particular torture, mutilations or cruel \ntreatment.\nb) The t\naking of hostages.\nc) Dep\nortations. \nd) Ou\ntrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating or degrad-\ning treatment, or adverse treatment founded on differences of race, \ncolour, nationality, religion, beliefs, sex, birth or social status. \ne)  The \npassing of sentences and the carrying out of executions with-\nout previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. \nIn the present edition, a Table is appended showing the division into Parts, Sections and Chapters, and reproducing the marginal notes to each Article. Reference to this Table will afford a complete outline of the subjects dealt with, and the position they occupy in the Convention.   \n32 PRELIMINARY REMARKS\nAmongst the General Provisions, Article 4 gives the following definition of \nthe persons who will have the benefit of the Convention: \n“Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and \nin any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupa-tion, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals. \n“Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected \nby it. \n“Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a bel-\nligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are. ”\nThe last two clauses were added by the Conference to the draft, which was \nfound too narrow on this particular point. \nPart II (Art. 13 to 26) concerns the general protection of populations against \ncertain consequences of war. It goes beyond the limits set up by Article 4, and covers the population as a whole, i.e. not only “protected persons” , but also those who cannot avail themselves of this protection and, in particular, those who are nationals of the Party to the conflict, or of the Occupying Power by whom they are held. \nThere is thus provision for hospital and safety zones and localities, and \nneutralized zones (Art. 14 and 15), for the protection of civilian hospitals (Art. 18), for measures in behalf of children (Art. 24) and for the exchange of family news (Art. 25). In all cases these measures are quite general in scope, giving neither the grounds, nor indeed any practical opportunity, for discrimination. \nPart III (Art. 27 to 141) defines the status and treatment of protected persons, \nand the manner of the application of the Convention. \nFollowing the precedent of the Tokyo Draft, it distinguishes between foreign \nnationals on the territory of a Party to the conflict, and the population of oc-cupied territories. \nIt is divided into five Sections. \nSection I contains provisions common to the above two categories of persons, \ndealing with the responsibilities of the State and of its agents (Art. 29), appli-cation to Protecting Powers and relief organizations (Art. 30), prohibition of corporal punishments (Art. 32), of collective penalties, terrorism, pillage and reprisals (Art. 33), and of the taking of hostages (Art. 34).     \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  33\nSection II relates to aliens in the territory of a Party to the conflict, and deals \nwith the right to leave the territory (Art. 35), protection in case of internment (Art. 41), and refugees (Art. 44). \nSection III contains the prescriptions for occupied territories, on such sub-\njects as inviolability of rights (Art. 47), deportations, transfers and evacua-tions (Art. 49), children (Art. 50), labour (Art. 51) food (Art. 55), hygiene and public health (Art. 56), spiritual assistance (Art. 58), relief (Art. 59 to 63), penal legislation (Art. 64 to 75), and treatment of detainees (Art. 76). \nSection IV deals with internment. It is divided into twelve Chapters, the con-\ntents of which are in general analogous to the provisions adopted for prison-ers of war. (Chapter I-General Provisions; Chapter II-Places of internment; Chapter III-Food and clothing ; Chapter IV-Hygiene and medical attention; Chapter V-Religious, intellectual and physical activities; Chapter VI-Personal property and financial resources; Chapter VII-Administration and discipline; Chapter VIII-Relations with the exterior; Chapter IX-Penal and disciplinary sanctions; Chapter X-Transfers of internees; Chapter XI-Deaths; Chapter XII-Release, repatriation and accommodation in neutral countries). \nSection V is devoted to Information Bureaux and the Central Agency, the \nfunctioning of which is to follow that of the Central Prisoners of War Agency.\nPart IV (Art. 142 to 159) concerns the execution of the Convention. Section I \n(General Provisions) contains, amongst others, the provision on the repres-sion of breaches of the Convention, already mentioned.\nFinally, the 1949 Diplomatic Conference passed eleven Resolutions which re-\nfer to the Geneva Conventions, but do not form part of them; they will also be found in the present edition. \nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  35\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral Provisions \n Ar\nticle 1\nThe High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for \nthe present Convention in all circumstances."

chronic asthma;* chronic bronchitis* lasting more than one year in captivity; bron-chiectasis;* etc.\nd)\n Ser\nious chronic affections of the circulatory system, for example: valvular lesions and \nmyocarditis,* which have shown signs of circulatory failure during captivity, even though the Mixed Medical Commission cannot detect any such signs at the time of examination; affections of the pericardium and the vessels (Buerger’s disease, aneu-rism of the large vessels); etc.\ne)\n Ser\nious chronic affections of the digestive organs, for example: gastric or duodenal \nulcer; sequelae of gastric operations performed in captivity; chronic gastritis enteritis or colitis, having lasted more than one year and seriously affecting the general condi-tion; cirrhosis of the liver; chronic cholecystopathy;* etc.\nf)\n Ser\nious chronic affections of the genito-urinary organs, for example: chronic dis-\neases of the kidney with consequent disorders; nephrectomy because of a tubercular kidney;

chronic neuritis lasting more than one year; etc.\nh)\n Ser\nious chronic diseases of the neuro-vegetative system, with considerable diminu-\ntion of mental or physical fitness, noticeable loss of weight and general asthenia.\ni) Blin\ndness of both eyes, or of one eye when the vision of the other is less than 1 in \n*  The decision of the Mixed Medical Commision shall be based to a great extent on the records kept by camp physi-\nci\nans and surgeons of the same nationality as the prisoners of war, or on an examination by medical specialists of \nthe Detaining Power.\n138 THIRD CONVENTION\nspite of the use of corrective glasses; diminution of visual acuity in cases where it is \nimpossible to restore it by correction to an acuity of 1/2 in at least one eye;* other grave ocular affections, for example: glaucoma, iritis, choroiditis; trachoma; etc.\nk)\n Audi\ntive disorders, such as total unilateral deafness, if the other ear does not discern \nthe ordinary spoken word at a distance of one metre;* etc.\nl) Ser\nious affections of metabolism, for example: diabetes mellitus requiring insulin \ntreatment; etc.\nm) Ser\nious disorders of the endocrine glands, for example: thyrotoxicosis; hypothyrosis; \nAddison’s disease; Simmonds’ cachexia; tetany; etc.\nn) Gra\nve and chronic disorders of the blood-forming organs.\no) Ser\nious case of chronic intoxication, for example: lead poisoning, mercury poison-\ning, morphinism, cocainism, alcoholism; gas or radiation poisoning; etc.\np) Chr\nonic affections of locomotion, with obvious functional disorders, for example: \narthritis deformans; primary and secondary progressive chronic polyarthritis; rheu-matism with serious clinical symptoms; etc.\nq)\n Ser\nious chronic skin diseases, not amenable to treatment.\nr) An\ny malignant growth.\ns) Ser\nious chronic infectious diseases, persisting for one year after their inception, for \nexample: malaria with decided organic impairment, amoebic or bacillary dysentery with grave disorders; tertiary visceral syphilis resistant to treatment; leprosy; etc.\nt)\n Ser\nious avitaminosis or serious inanition.\nB.  Accommodation in neutral countries\nThe following shall be eligible for accommodation in a neutral country:\n1) Al\nl wounded prisoners of war who are not likely to recover in captivity, but who might \nbe cured or whose condition might be considerably improved by accommodation in a \nneutral country.\n2) Pr\nisoners of war suffering from any form of tuberculosis, of whatever organ, and whose \ntreatment in a neutral country would be likely to lead to recovery or at least to consider-able improvement, with the exception of primary tuberculosis cured before captivity.\n3)\n Pr\nisoners of war suffering from affections requiring treatment of the respiratory, circula-\ntory, digestive, nervous, sensory, genito-urinary, cutaneous, locomotive organs, etc., if such treatment would clearly have better results in a neutral country than in captivity.\n4)\n Pr\nisoners of war who have undergone a nephrectomy in captivity for a non-tubercular \nrenal affection; cases of osteomyelitis, on the way to recovery or latent; diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin treatment; etc.\n*  The decision of the Mixed Medical Commision shall be based to a great extent on the records kept by camp physi-\nci\nans and surgeons of the same nationality as the prisoners of war, or on an examination by medical specialists of \nthe Detaining Power.\nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949  139\n5) Prisoners of war suffering from war or captivity neuroses.\n Ca\nses of captivity neurosis which are not cured after three months of accommodation in \na neutral country, or which after that length of time are not clearly on the way to com-\nplete cure, shall be repatriated.\n6) Al\nl prisoners of war suffering from chronic intoxication (gases, metals, alkaloids, etc.), \nfor whom the prospects of cure in a neutral country are especially favourable.\n7) All women prisoners of war who are pregnant or mothers with infants and small children.\nThe following cases shall not be eligible for accommodation in a neutral country:\n1) Al\nl duly verified chronic psychoses.\n2) Al\nl organic or functional nervous affections considered to be incurable.\n3) Al\nl contagious diseases during the period in which they are transmissible, with the ex-\nception of tuberculosis.\nII.  GENERAL O BSERVATIONS\n1) The conditions given shall, in a general way, be interpreted and applied in as broad a \ns\npirit as possible.\n Neur\nopathic and psychopathic conditions caused by war or captivity, as well as cases of \ntuberculosis in all stages, shall above all benefit by such liberal interpretation. Prisoners of war who have sustained several wounds, none of which, considered by itself, justifies repatriation, shall be examined in the same spirit, with due regard for the psychic trau-matism due to the number of their wounds.\n2)\n Al\nl unquestionable cases giving the right to direct repatriation (amputation, total blind-\nness or deafness, open pulmonary tuberculosis, mental disorder, malignant growth, etc.) shall be examined and repatriated as soon as possible by the camp physicians or by mili-tary medical commissions appointed by the Detaining Power.\n3)\n In\njuries and diseases which existed before the war and which have not become worse, \nas well as war injuries which have not prevented subsequent military service, shall not entitle to direct repatriation.\n4)\n The provisions of this Annex shall be interpreted and applied in a similar manner in all countries party to the conflict. The Powers and authorities concerned shall grant to Mixed Medical Commissions all the facilities necessary for the accomplishment of their task.\n5) The examples quoted under (I) above represent only typical cases. Cases which do not cor-respond exactly to these provisions shall be judged in the spirit of the provisions of Article 110 of the present Convention, and of the principles embodied in the present Agreement.\n140 THIRD CONVENTION\nANNEX II\nreGul\nations  c\noncernin G Mixed  Med\nical  c\noMMiss\nions\n(see Article 112)"

that, in the case of a dispute relating to the interpretation or \napplication of the present Conventions which cannot be settled by other means, the High Contracting Parties concerned endeavour to agree between themselves to refer such dispute to the International Court of Justice. \nResolution 2\nWhereas circumstances may arise in the event of the outbreak of a future international con-flict in which there will be no Protecting Power with whose cooperation and under whose scrutiny the Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War can be applied; and\nwhereas Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the \nWounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, Article 10 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, and Article 11 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of August 12, 1949, provide that the High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to a body which of-fers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the aforesaid Conventions,\nthe Conference recommends that consideration be given as soon as possible to the advis-\nability of setting up an international body, the functions of which shall be, in the absence of a Protecting Power, to fulfil the duties performed by Protecting Powers in regard to the applica-tion of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims. \nResolution 3\nWhereas agreements may only with difficulty be concluded during hostilities;\nwhereas Article 28 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the \nWounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, provides that the Parties to the conflict shall, during hostilities, make arrangements for relieving where possible re-tained personnel, and shall settle the procedure of such relief;\nwhereas Article 31 of the same Convention provides that, as from the outbreak of hostilities, \nParties to the conflict may determine by special arrangement the percentage of personnel to be retained, in proportion to the number of prisoners and the distribution of the said person-nel in the camps,\nthe Conference requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare a model \nagreement on the two questions referred to in the two Articles mentioned above and to sub-mit it to the High Contracting Parties for their approval. \n216 RESO LUTIONS\nResolution 4\nWhereas Article 33 of the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, for the Relief of the Wounded \nand Sick in Armies in the Field, concerning the identity documents to be carried by medical personnel, was only partially observed during the course of the recent war, thus creating seri-ous difficulties for many members of such personnel,\nthe Conference recommends that States and National Red Cross Societies take all necessary \nsteps in time of peace to have medical personnel duly provided with the badges and identity cards prescribed in Article 40 of the new Convention. \nResolution 5\nWhereas misuse has frequently been made of the Red Cross emblem,\nthe Conference recommends that States take strict measures to ensure that the said em-\nblem, as well as other emblems referred to in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, is used only within the limits prescribed by the Geneva Conventions, in order to safeguard their authority and protect their high significance. \nResolution 6\nWhereas the present Conference has not been able to raise the question of the technical study of means of communication between hospital ships, on the one hand, and warships and mili-tary aircraft on the other, since that study went beyond its terms of reference;\nwhereas this question is of the greatest importance for the safety and efficient operation of \nhospital ships,\nthe Conference recommends that the High Contracting Parties will, in the near future, in-\nstruct a Committee of Experts to examine technical improvements of modern means of com-munication between hospital ships, on the one hand, and warships and military aircraft, on the other, and also to study the possibility of drawing up an International Code laying down precise regulations for the use of those means, in order that hospital ships may be assured of the maximum protection and be enabled to operate with the maximum efficiency. \nResolution 7\nThe Conference, being desirous of securing the maximum protection for hospital ships, ex-presses the hope that all High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Convention for the Amel-ioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, will arrange that, when ever conveniently practicable, such ships shall frequently and regularly broadcast particulars of their position, route and speed. \nGENEVA CONVENTION OF 1949  217\nResolution 8\nThe Conference wishes to affirm before all nations:\nthat, its work having been inspired solely by humanitarian aims, its earnest hope is that, in the \nfuture, Governments may never have to apply the Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims;\nthat its strongest desire is that the Powers, great and small, may always reach a friendly settle-\nment of their differences through cooperation and understanding between nations, so that peace shall reign on earth for ever. \nResolution 9\nWhereas Article 71 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, provides that prisoners of war who have been without news for a long period, or who are unable to receive news from their next of kin or to give them news by the ordinary postal route, as well as those who are at a great distance from their home, shall be permitted to send telegrams, the fees being charged against the prisoners of war’s account with the Detaining Power or paid in the currency at their disposal, and that prisoners of war shall likewise benefit by these facilities in cases of urgency; and\nwhereas to reduce the cost, often prohibitive, of such telegrams or cables, it appears necessary \nthat some method of grouping messages should be introduced whereby a series of short speci-men messages concerning personal health, health of relatives at home, schooling, finance, etc., could be drawn up and numbered, for use by prisoners of war in the aforesaid circumstances,\nthe Conference, therefore, requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare \na series of specimen messages covering these requirements and to submit them to the High Contracting Parties for their approval. \nResolution 10\nThe Conference considers that the conditions under which a Party to a conflict can be recog-nized as a belligerent by Powers not taking part in this conflict, are governed by the general rules of international law on the subject and are in no way modified by the Geneva Conven-tions.  \nResolution 11\nWhereas the Geneva Conventions require the International Committee of the Red Cross to be ready at all times and in all circumstances to fulfil the humanitarian tasks entrusted to it by these Conventions,\nthe Conference recognizes the necessity of providing regular financial support for the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. \nMission\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) \nis an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance. The ICRC also endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. Established in 1863, the ICRC is at the origin of the Geneva Conventions and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It directs and coordinates the international activities conducted by the Movement in armed conflicts and other situations of violence.\nTHE GENEVA  \nCONVENTIONS  OF 12 AUGUST 1949\nTHE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 12 AUGUST 1949\nICRC0173/002   01.2012   7,000"
